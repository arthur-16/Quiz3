. Take this new array of data and paste it into the api.js file

2. You will need to have one button that will create a random card, which uses the data from the api.all method

3. When you click on an ‘X’ or something on the card that indicates deletion, you need to remove that card from the screen

4. You need to add a `create` method into the api (this method will return a promise), which will be responsible for adding a new data new object to the array (hint: when you create the new object to the array, it does not have to immediately be rendered to the screen)

5. The creation must be from an input box and button.
